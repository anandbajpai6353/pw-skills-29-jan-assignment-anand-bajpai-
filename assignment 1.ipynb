    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum. He started working on Python in the late 1980s and released the first version, Python 0.9.0, in February 1991. Guido van Rossum continued to lead the development of Python until he stepped down as the language's Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) in July 2018. Since then, Python development has been carried out by a community of volunteers, guided by the Python Software Foundation (PSF)."

    "Reference Counting: Python uses a reference counting mechanism to keep track of objects in memory. Each object has a reference count that keeps track of the number of references pointing to it. When an object's reference count reaches zero, meaning there are no more references to it, Python deallocates the memory occupied by the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage Collection: In addition to reference counting, Python also employs a garbage collector to detect and collect cyclic references. Cyclic references occur when a group of objects reference each other, forming a loop that prevents them from being garbage collected based solely on reference counting. The garbage collector periodically identifies and releases such cyclic references, freeing up memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Allocation: Python has its own memory manager, responsible for managing the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks used by Python objects. The memory manager handles memory allocation requests, tracks free memory blocks, and returns memory back to the system when objects are deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Optimizations: Python provides various memory optimization techniques, such as object reuse and memory pooling. Reusing objects, especially immutable ones like strings, reduces the overhead of creating new objects. Memory pooling involves preallocating and reusing memory blocks for frequently used objects, improving performance and reducing memory fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Object Heap (LOH): Python maintains a separate heap, known as the Large Object Heap (LOH), for larger objects. This helps optimize memory usage and reduces fragmentation by segregating larger objects from smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "C Extensions and Memory Management: Python supports C extensions, and memory allocated by C extensions is managed separately. Python provides an API for C extension developers to handle memory management and ensure proper integration with Python's memory management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's memory management is designed to provide automatic memory management without requiring explicit memory allocation and deallocation by the programmer. It helps developers focus on writing code without worrying about low-level memory operations, improving productivity and reducing the risk of memory leaks and memory-related errors."

    "9. Apply Changes: Click \"OK\" on each window to apply the changes and close the windows.\n",
